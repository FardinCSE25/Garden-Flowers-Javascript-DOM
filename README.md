## ❓ JavaScript Question & Answers
✔️ What is the difference between var, let, and const?
var

Function scoped

Can be redeclared

Can be reassigned

Hoisted with default value undefined

let

Block scoped

Cannot be redeclared

Can be reassigned

Not accessible before initialization (Temporal Dead Zone)

const

Block scoped

Cannot be redeclared

Cannot be reassigned

Must be initialized during declaration

✔️ What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
map()

Returns a new array

Applies a function to each element

Used when you want modified output

forEach()

Loops through array

Does not return anything

Used for side-effects (console, DOM update)

filter()

Returns a new array with matched items

Filters values based on a condition

✔️ What are Arrow Functions in ES6?

Arrow functions provide a shorter and cleaner syntax than regular functions.

Regular Function:
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

Arrow Function:
const add = (a, b) => a + b;


No function keyword

No {} needed for one-line return

Shorter and readable syntax

✔️ How Does Destructuring Assignment Work?

Destructuring is used to extract values from arrays or objects easily.

Array Destructuring:
const [name, price] = ["Rose", 120];

Object Destructuring:
const { title, amount } = product;

✔️ Explain Template Literals in ES6

Template literals use backticks (`) and allow:

Multiline text

Variable embedding

Avoiding string concatenation

String Concatenation:
const text = "I am " + name + " from " + place;

Template Literal:
const text = `I am ${name} from ${place}`;
